# Methods of Numerical Analysis labworks #
This repository contains 6 labworks from the Methods of Numerical Analysis course. Original full tasks may be found [here](https://libeldoc.bsuir.by/bitstream/123456789/28916/1/Anisimov_Metody.pdf):
### Lab 1 ###
Research of collocation, galerkin, integral and discrete least square methods in finding boundary problem solutions.
### Lab 2 ###
Finding solutions of boundary problems using difference approximation methods.
### Lab 3 ###
Research of grid method for solving a one-dimensional non stationary heat equations.
### Lab 4 ###
Approximation of the boundary conditions of the second kind in the finite difference method.
### Lab 5 ###
Research of grid method for solving the Dirichlet problem for the Poisson equation.
### Lab 6 ###
Research of grid method for solving the wave equation.

### How to run? ###
To run this labworks I would recommend you to use [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) and run them one by one via spyder IDE. To acces this IDE you should type this after you've installed anaconda:
```bash
$ anaconda-navigator
```
Or make sure that you have installed:
* [Numpy](https://www.scipy.org/scipylib/download.html)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html)
* [Sympy](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/releases)
